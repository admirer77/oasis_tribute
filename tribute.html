                A dream smartphone — one that marries fast, high-end hardware with equally high-end design — is what Pete Lau set out to build when he quit OPPO at the end of 2013 after working there 15 years. He had started as a hardware engineer at OPPO, eventually became the director of the Blu-Ray division and finally led their marketing team through many challenges in their pursuit of creating a great mobile brand. Pete then moved to launch OnePlus, a Shenzhen-based tech startup that aims to disrupt the smartphone industry. Last week, the company unveiled its first smartphone called OnePlus One. With bated breath, the world is waiting to see if this phone -- due to hit the market late May -- is going to be a game-changer for the industry.
